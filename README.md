# PixelBoi: The Game

> ðŸ‘¾ WebGl files for my game called PixelBoi, a 2D platformer and sidescrolling game created using the Unity game engine and C#.

First game I created after learning the fundamentals of coding. Written with C#. Note that all art and music is not created by me. Make sure to go fullscreen to maximise pleasure -> https://peetacho.github.io/PixelBoi/
